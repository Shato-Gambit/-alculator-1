# -alculator-1
This code defines a function called calculate that takes three arguments: two numbers (num1 and num2) and an operator (operator). The function uses an if statement to determine which operation to perform based on the value of the operator argument, and then returns the result of the operation.

The code then prompts the user to enter the two numbers and the operator, and stores the user's input in variables num1, num2, and operator. Finally, it calls the calculate function and prints the result to the console.

For example, if the user enters "2" for the first number, "4" for the second number, and "+" for the operator, the code will print the result "6.0" to the console.
